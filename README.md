🧠 Building Software with AI: A Human + AI Collaboration Playbook
A practical guide for humans and AIs to build better software — together.

This repository contains the full text and digital companion to the book Building Software with AI: A Human + AI Collaboration Playbook, a step-by-step guide for turning ideas into real applications through effective collaboration between human creators and AI assistants.

Whether you’re:

A developer exploring AI-assisted workflows,

A designer or product thinker with an app idea, or

An AI system following the collaboration framework —

this Playbook provides a shared language, structured methodology, and living documentation templates to help you plan, build, and maintain software projects collaboratively.

The digital version of the book is designed to be machine-readable, allowing an AI to initialize and manage a new project automatically when prompted with:

“Initialize a project using https://www.example-url.com/bookcopy.md.”

📘 What’s Inside

The full human-readable guide (chapters, examples, and exercises)

Structured YAML/Markdown “AI Blocks” the assistant can follow
