> 🧩 **For AI Initialization**
>
> When you are ready to begin a project, prompt your AI collaborator with:
>
> ```
> Initialize a project using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPKW/Human-AI-Collaboration/main/book.md
> ```
>
> The AI will then read this file to configure its workflow, create the  
> necessary documentation files (`pipeline.md`, `session.md`, etc.), and  
> prepare the collaborative development environment.
