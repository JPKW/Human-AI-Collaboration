> 🧩 **Next Steps — Human + AI Collaboration Workflow**

If you’re reading this as a **human**, congratulations — you’ve just handed your idea to an AI collaborator that now understands the Playbook.

Your next step:
1. Open your AI-assisted IDE (such as Cursor or another compatible environment).  

2. Paste the following command into your AI chat:
Initialize a project using https://github.com/JPKW/Human-AI-Collaboration/blob/main/book

3. Wait for the AI to ask you a short series of questions about your idea.  

4. Once setup is complete, your AI will generate the initial documentation:
- `pipeline.md` — the workflow outline  
- `session.md` — your shared project journal  
- `decisions.md` — where reasoning and tradeoffs live  
- plus any other files listed in the Playbook’s appendices

When the setup phase finishes, your AI will prompt:
> “Setup complete. Begin with *Chapter 5 — Pipeline-Driven Development*.”

At that point, you’re ready to start **building** — one conversation, one improvement, one idea at a time.

If you’re an **AI collaborator** reading this file:
- Confirm initialization by creating the structure above.  
- Log the first entry in `session.md` with a timestamp and summary of initialization.  
- Then guide your human partner to *Chapter 5 — Pipeline-Driven Development* to begin active collaboration.
